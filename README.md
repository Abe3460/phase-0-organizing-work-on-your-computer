# Organizing Your Work for this Course

From now on, you'll be executing code on your own computer. For each and every lab, you'll be copying the code to your computer using [Git](https://git-scm.com).  You will then be able to run and test your code in your terminal, and submit your work using the learn-co gem.

> **Note for WSL Users: Although the video above is for the macOS, the commands shown in the terminal will be the same in
> your Ubuntu shell. When you open Ubuntu, you should start in your home directory. Confirm this with the command `pwd`. In
> Ubuntu, your home directory will start off empty, so there will not be a `Development` folder present, and running `ls` will
> not produce any results. You can create a `Development` folder with `mkdir Development`.
