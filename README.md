# How to Organize Your Work for this Course

From now on, you'll be executing code on you own computer instead of relying on the Learn IDE during your PREWORK. For each and every lab, you'll be copying the code to your computer using [Git](https://git-scm.com).  You will then be able to run and test your code in your terminal, and submit your work using the learn-co gem.  

If you haven't installed the learn-co gem or gone through the manual set up steps for your computer, you should follow [these instructions](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/immersive-mod-1-introduction-manual-setup) first.

> **Note for WSL Users: Although the video above is for the macOS, the commands shown in the terminal will be the same in
> your Ubuntu shell. When you open Ubuntu, you should start in your home directory. Confirm this with the command `pwd`.
> In this folder, you may not have a directory called `Development` initially, but can create one with `mkdir Development`
